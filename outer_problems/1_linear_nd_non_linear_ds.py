"""
Linear
    A datastructure is linear when all the elements arranged in a linear(sequential) order.
    Ex: stack, array, queue, linked list
    Exception: first element doesn't have precedes and last element doesn't have a succeeds

Non-Linear
    A datastructure is non linear when all the elements not arranged in a linear (sequential) order.
    There is no linear arrangement of the elements.
    Ex: Tree, Graph

Static DataStructure
    In these type of data structure, the memory is allocated at the compile time. therefore, maximum size is fixed.
    Adv: Fastaccess
    DisAdv: Slower Insertion and deletion
    Ex: array

Dynamic DS
    In these type of ds, the memory is allocated at the run time.therefore, maximum size is flexible.
    Adv:  Faster Insertion and deletion
    DisAdv: Slower access
    Ex: Linked list
